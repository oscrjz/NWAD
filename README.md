Network Attack Detection Project 
Objective:

Aim: The project aims to enhance network security by identifying and logging network attacks such as SYN Flood and DDoS. By monitoring network traffic and identifying patterns indicative of these attacks, the project seeks to provide an early warning system for network administrators.

Motivations:

Real-world relevance: Network attacks are a common threat to businesses, governments, and individuals. Detecting and mitigating these attacks can prevent data breaches, service disruptions, and financial losses.

Value: Implementing such a system can help in improving the overall security posture of the network, making it more resilient against potential threats. This project demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using Python and Scapy for network security purposes.
